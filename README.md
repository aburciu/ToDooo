To-Dooo
========

To-Dooo is a light-weight, fast, To-do app, using an **API in the backend**, easily exposing your tasks data (and progress) to web services.

Built with modern technologies, including **React** and **Bootstrap** in the Front-End, it relies on a backend written in **Python**, while running on Flask.

To run To-Dooo you will need Pyhton 3.0 or greater (preferably 3.4 or latest).
